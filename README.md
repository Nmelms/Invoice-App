# Invoice App
I am excited to share this full stack CRUD app that I created using React and Firebase. Throughout the development process, I learned an incredible amount and was able to apply my skills in new ways.

One challenge that I faced was the difficulty of passing props between components. To solve this issue, I decided to utilize the Context API. In comparison to other state management tools like Redux, I found the Context API to be more lightweight and suitable for my project's needs. It allowed me to efficiently manage my app's state without the added complexity of a more robust solution.

In addition to using the Context API, I also decided to incorporate a back-end into my project. Rather than relying on local storage, I chose to implement Firebase. While there was a learning curve involved, I was able to get the back-end up and running smoothly.

The design for the app was provided to me through a Figma file. Overall, I am pleased with the final result and feel that the app turned out well.

# Features
* Create new invoices
* Edit existing invoices
* Save invoices as drafts
* Delete invoices
# How to Use the App
The app is hosted [HERE](https://nmelmsinvoice.netlify.app). When you first open the app, you can sign in with an existing username or create a new account. If you prefer, you can also use the "continue as guest" option to test out the app without creating an account.

To create a new invoice, click "new invoice" and fill out the fields. When you are finished, you can save the invoice or choose "save as draft" to finish it later. To edit an invoice, click on it from the main screen and choose "edit". You can also delete invoices by clicking the "delete" button.
