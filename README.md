<h1>Invoice App</h1>

This is a full stack CRUD app I created using React and Firebase. I learned an insane amount on this project. I quickly realized how big a hassle passing props can be so I decided to use the Context API. I went with the Context API over something like Redux because Context seemed a little more light-weight and I didn't need any crazy state management, this worked perfectly for my project. Instead of using the local storage, I decided to add a back-end to this project. I settled on Firebase and while it was a bit of a learning curve I managed to get it up and running pretty smoothly. The design was given to me via Figma file. Overall I'm happy with the way it turned out.

<h2>How to use the app</h2>
Currently you dont need to sign in so everyone uses the same database. You can create, edit and delete invoices. Feel free to create a new invoice by clicking on the New button.
